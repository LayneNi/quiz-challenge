# Quiz Challenge

## Description

My motivation for building this project was to create a short, fun quiz by utilizing javascript. I built this project to learn and become familiar with the way that javascript is used to add interactivity to a website. I learned a lot about how to apply the different properties, methods and objects incorporated in javascript to a real working website.
